The final version of the machine learning project is a jupyter notebook and png files. 

The program reads in the features of the pngs, which include the number of different shades of blue and red, 
the number of blue pixels (all shades) and the number of red pixels (all shades), and the number pixels that 
are completely blue (0,0,255,255) and completely red (255,0,0,255) in RGBA format.

The files are then classified using labeled data, with a KNN classifier, with K = 3.

The user can then imput unclassified files to be predicted, and the usable files, which are those labeled good 
or okay, are returned.

The results are

This folder contains the project assignment "Try different features and algorithms".

Instructions:
Some of you have already a working model after the previous assignment, and some still have not completed that. 
For the next deadline, I would like to see some results from your models. So, what I need is really an evaluation
of your working model using the evaluation metrics that make sense for your task, this includes accuracy, Precision, 
Recall, F1, or maybe something specific for your task.

Evaluate your features try a few different learning algorithms. 
Describe what algorithms and via which tools you have used.  
Evaluate various models and report performance of your model on your test data. 
You can provide the evaluation on your test data or use cross-validation. 
Please be communicative about it and let me know what is your approach for improving your initial results. 
Post your main test results on canvas and codes on your GitHub repository.
